                    <p className="info-div-par">
                        There are a number of justifiable reasons under the GDPR that allow collection and processing
                        of Personal Data. The main avenues we rely on are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>"<strong>Consent</strong>": Certain situations allow us to collect your Personal Data, such as when you

                                to a service.</li>
                            <li>“<strong>Contractual Obligations</strong>”: We may require certain information from you in order to
                                fulfil our contractual obligations and provide you with the promised service.</li>
                            <li>“<strong>Legal compliance</strong>”: We’re required by law to collect and process certain types of data,
                                such as fraudulent activity or other illegal actions.</li>
                            <li>"<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong>”: We might need to collect certain information from you to be
                                able to meet our legitimate interests - this covers aspects that can be reasonably
                                expected as part of running our business, that will not have a material impact on your
                                rights, freedom or interests. Examples could be your address, so that we know where to
                                deliver something to, or your name, so that we have a record of who to contact moving
                                forwards.</li>
